## I. Formal Proofs

Use the rules of inference from class (reprinted below) to construct formal, numbered proofs of the following:

### 1. 

Assuming _p -> q_ and _p -> r_, prove _p -> (q AND r)_

```
1. p->q
2. p->r
3. Assume p
4. 1, 3 MP q
5. 2, 3 MP r
6. 4, 5 Conjunction q^r
7. Therefore p->q^r
```

### 2.

Assuming _p -> (q OR r)_ and _p -> (q OR NOT r)_, prove _p -> q_


```
1. p -> (q OR r)
2. p -> (q OR NOT R)
3. Assume p
4. 1,3 MP q OR r
5. 2,3 MP q OR NOT r
6. Assume q
7. 4, 6 Generalization q OR r
8. 5, 6 Generalization q OR NOT r
Therefore both assumptions are true when q so p -> q
```

## II. Truth tables

Use a truth table to show the equivalence of the assumptions and conclusion from problem 1, above:  Assuming _p -> q_ and _p -> r_, prove _p -> (q AND r)_

[Style note:  what is the canonical order of the rows in a truth table for three propositions?]


_p_ | _q_ | _r_ | _p -> q_ | _p -> r_ | _p -> (q AND r)_ 
----|-----|-----|----------|----------|------
 0  |  0  | 0   |     1    |     1    |    1
 0  |  0  | 1   |     1    |     1    |    1
 0  |  1  | 0   |     1    |     1    |    1
 0  |  1  | 1   |     1    |     1    |    1
 1  |  0  | 0   |     0    |     0    |    0
 1  |  0  | 1   |     0    |     1    |    0    
 1  |  1  | 0   |     1    |     0    |    0
 1  |  1  | 1   |     1    |     1    |    1

In each case that our assumptions are true, the conculsion is also true.

## III. Tautology, satisfiable, contradiction

Which of the following are tautologies?  Satisfiable?  Unsatisfiable (contradictions)?

### 1. _(p AND q AND r) -> (p OR q)_

Tautology, satisfiable.

### 2. _((p -> q) AND (q -> r)) -> (p -> r)_

Tautology, satisfiable.

### 3. _(p -> q) -> p_

Not a tautology, satisfiable.

### 4. _(p OR q OR r) AND ((NOT p) OR (NOT q) OR (NOT r)) AND (p OR (NOT q)) AND (q OR (NOT r)) OR (r OR (not p))_ 

Not a tautology, satisfiable. While p = 1, q = 0, r = 0 and p = 1, q = 1, r = 0 are viable in section of AND statements, neither of these holds true with the final or statement _(r OR (not p))_ but this does not matter as it is not connected to the rest of the statement by an AND so it does not matter. If this was in CNF (which is close to being), it would be unsatisfiable. It is not a tautology because not all values hold true, like p = 0, q = 0, r = 0, fails the first part of the statement, _(p OR q OR r)_.

Edit: with update that the last OR should have been an AND, this is unsatisfiable, as stated in the previous paraphraph.

### 5. [** challenge/optional] _(p <=> (q OR r)) -> ((NOT q) -> (p AND r))_



## IV. CNF

Transform the following formula into conjunctive normal form.  Show your steps.

_p OR (q AND NOT (r AND (s -> t)))_

```
Eliminate Implication: p OR (q AND NOT (r AND ((NOT s) OR T))))
DeMorgan's: p OR (q AND ((NOT r) OR (NOT ((NOT s) OR T))
DeMorgan's: p OR (q AND ((NOT r) OR ((NOT NOT s) AND (NOT T)))
Double Neg: p OR (q AND ((NOT r) OR (s AND (NOT T)))
Distributive: (p OR q) AND (p OR ((NOT r) OR (s AND (NOT T))))
Distributive: (p OR q) AND (p OR (((NOT r) OR s) AND ((NOT r) OR (NOT t))))
Distributive (p OR q) AND (p OR ((NOT r) OR s)) AND (p or ((NOT r) OR (NOT t))) 
Associative: (p OR q) AND (p OR (NOT r) OR s) AND (p OR (NOT r) OR (NOT t))
```


## V. Short certificate

Demonstrate that the formula in problem IV is satisfiable.  Explain whether you used a  "short certificate" or exhaustive enumeration to make this determination.

If _p_ is true the statement is always true, therefore an solution exists and it is satisfiable. I used a short certificate because I was able to only evaluate the first element and stop after realizing it can evaluate to true in which case the whole statement will be true.
